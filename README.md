# ðŸ§  EMG Signal Noise Removal

This project demonstrates how to remove **power-line interference (50/60 Hz)** from **Electromyography (EMG)** signals using digital filtering techniques. It includes a basic implementation of **bandpass filtering**, **RMS calculation**, and **FFT visualization before and after noise removal**.

## ðŸ©» Project Objectives

- ðŸ“‰ Load and visualize raw EMG data (with noise)
- ðŸ§¹ Remove 50/60 Hz noise using a band-stop or band-pass filter
- ðŸ“ˆ Perform Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to visualize frequency components
- ðŸ§  Calculate Root Mean Square (RMS) of cleaned signal
